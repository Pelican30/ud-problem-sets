## Bigger wordplay questions

The questions after this section are all real 60-minute interview questions from tech companies. Before you move on to those questions, we recommend confirming that you are comfortable independently breaking down, implementing, and debugging the questions below.

If you aren’t, work with your mentor on more similarly-sized questions until you are consistently able to solve them independently, before moving on.

[ ] What is the longest word where no letter is used more than once?
[ ] What are all of the words that are at least 8 letters long and use 3 or fewer different letters? For example, “REFERRER” is an answer to this question, because it uses only 3 different letters: R, E, and F.
[ ] What are all of the words that have at least 3 different double letters? For example, “BOOKKEEPER” is an answer to this question because it has a double-O, a double-K, and a double-E.
[ ] Write a function that takes a string `availableLetters` as an argument and returns an array of all of the words that can be made from only those letters. Letters can be re-used as many times as needed and can appear in any order. Not all of the letters in `availableLetters` have to be used.
[ ] What are all of the compound words? These are words made up of 2 smaller words. For example, “SNOWMAN” is a compound word made from “SNOW” and “MAN”, and “BEACHBALL” is a compound word made from “BEACH” and “BALL”.
[ ] Finding alphabet chains: - First, what are all of the words that have a least one “A”, one “B”, one “C”, one “D”, one “E”, and one “F” in them, in any order? - For example, “FEEDBACK” is an answer to this question - Next, is “ABCDEF” the longest alphabet chain that can be found in a word, or is there a longer chain starting somewhere else in the alphabet? Find the longest chain and the words that can be made from that chain.
